# Astro-Kit
iOS Application with a physics sandbox. 

Astro-Kit is an educational app that brings a more tangible, hands on approach to learning. Users can browse the App's Discovery module to read about our Solar System's planets, close stars, and notable moons, or jump right into the Sandbox module to interact with massive bodies, and see how alterations to mass and position affects object behavior.

This application was release for iOS in the fall of 2015. It remained there until December of 2015 after which my license expired and the App removed from the store. 
Little remains to be found of my App now. A reference to it by appstor.io remains [here](http://astro-kit-bzr1zo.appstor.io).

Some screenshots and a trailer remain:

[Trailer](https://vimeo.com/134171264) (short to meet 30s App store limitation of the time)

**Current State:** I cannot guarantee that this App will work if compiled and deployed to the devices of others right now. I can confirm it runs at this time on a device running iOS 10.3.2, although some animations are broken and images glitchy in the simulator.
